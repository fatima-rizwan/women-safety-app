## About this Project

This project is a modified version of an open-source Flutter Women Safety App originally created by [Fahad Islam](https://github.com/fahad-islam1/flutter-women-safety-app-).  
I customized and enhanced it for my Final Year Project (FYP).
The Women Safety App is a powerful mobile application designed to provide essential safety features for women. This app ensures safety through secure chat functionality with guardians, the ability to send messages, and location data, and chatting with trusted guardians.

## Key Features

- **Secure Chat with Guardians:** The app allows users to communicate with their designated guardians in real-time via a secure and private chat interface.

- **Message Sending:** Users can send and receive text messages instantly, facilitating quick communication in emergency situations.

- **Location Sharing:** Share your real-time location with guardians, enabling them to track your whereabouts and ensure your safety.

- **Simulated Location:** Test the app's functionality by simulating your location, allowing you to send mock location data to your guardians.

- **Emergency Services:** Quickly locate nearby police stations, bus stops, ambulance services, and hospitals with one tap.
